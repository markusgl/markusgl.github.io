	<p>Welcome to my GitHub page!<br/>
		My name is <em>Markus</em> and I am a student in the research master program at TH NÃ¼rnberg. 
		This website was created to write about my projects and share my publications. I am mainly working on Conversational Interfaces at the moment, but also very interested in Machine Learning and Data Science. 
		During the next few months this website will grow and filled with content about my work and some other projects I have worked on during my spare time.<br/><br/>
	For now you can browse through my <a href="/publications">publications</a> (mostly in German) or my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/markusgl?tab=repositories">GitHub repositories</a>.
